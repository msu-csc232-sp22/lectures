# Week 1 - Data Abstraction: The Walls

This folder contains source code examples managed by a `CMakeLists.txt` file. To build the various targets prescribed by this build system, execute the following commands. Your output will, of course, differ this output, but it will be similar.

```bash
$ cmake -S . -B ./build

NOTE: The `$` shown in these command line terminal windows is merely the command line prompt.

Once `cmake` is run, a `Makefile` is generated that can be used with `make` to generate executables, as shown below.

```bash
$ make -C ./build

The key targets that were built are

1. `week01` - this is often referred to as the "main" target by your instructor as it was built by compiling `src/main.cpp`.
2. `week02-demo` - this is often referred to as the "demo" target by your instructor as it was built by compiling `src/demo.cpp`.
3. `week02-test` - this is often referred to as the "test" target by your instructor as it was built by compiling `test/test.cpp`. This executable will run a GoogleTest suite on your solutions to assess a "program correctness" grade.

Finally, now that we have executables (targets) to run, let's execute them.

```bash
$ ./build/week01/week01
Hello, main!
$./build/week01/week01-demo
Hello, demo!
$ ./build/week01/week01-tests                                                                                   127 â†µ
